In this class project I implemented different loop designs for comparison. 

This includes: 
- N^2 nested loop
- Hashed block nested loop
- Zhou's SIMD-based nested loop
- SIMD Hashed block nested loop

It was pretty fun and the results are interesting since SIMD doesn't always win.

This is the code used to study the performance of various main-memory hash join
algorithms for the following SIGMOD 2011 paper:

Spyros Blanas, Yinan Li, Jignesh M. Patel: Design and evaluation of main
memory hash join algorithms for multi-core CPUs. In SIGMOD Conference, 
p. 37-48, 2011. (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sblanas/files/multijoin.tar.bz2)
